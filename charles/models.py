We extend Django's built-in User with a Profile using a OneToOneField.
This is the recommended approach when you need extra user data but do not
need to change how authentication itself works.

    Stores extra information tied to a registered user.

    OneToOneField enforces a strict 1-to-1 relationship:
      - Each User has exactly one Profile.
      - Deleting a User automatically deletes its Profile (CASCADE).
      - related_name='profile' lets us write request.user.profile cleanly.
